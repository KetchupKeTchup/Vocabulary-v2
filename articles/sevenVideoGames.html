                                    This old stereotype of gamers being isolated loners is quite frankly boring and outdated.Video games have long since come out of the bedroom and into the world.

Urban legend states that his shape was inspired by a pizza minus a couple of slices. Pac-man tried something different. In it you had to use your wits and strategically evade enemies until you were strong enough to chase them down instead. Pac-man quickly bacame a pop culture phenomenon featuring on t-shirts, ties, glasses, bags, balloons, board, games, books, caps and any other merchandise that sat around in one spot for too long.

                                    Of all the video game characters to grace our consoles over the years, none have made an impact quite like Mario. The side-scrolling platform game featured a plumber trying to rescue a princess from a fire-breathing turtle and a labyrinth of pipes and platforms to traverse while avoiding razor-toothed plants and even odder-looking mushrooms. And so of course it captured gamers' hearts and became one of the fastest-sellikng video games of all time.

                                    Tomb Raider was the butt-kicking, action-adventure game that sold PlayStation consoles by the bucketload and introdused the world to fictional archaeologist/treasure hunter Lara Croft. As one of the first ever notable female game protagonists Lara's Launch in 1996 had already caused a media sensation. If Pac-man was gaming's first ever character and Mario its first mascot, Lara Croft was its first icon. Now you could argue that Lara is really more a source of male titillation than female empowerment but she one of the first playable women i remenber seeing in a video game and that representation really mattered.
